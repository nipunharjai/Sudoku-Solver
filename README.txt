The program, written in Python 3.x, is a Sudoku Solving algorithm based
on the "BACKTRACKING" approach.

Bascially, we put in values recursively until we hit an incorrect condition,
upon which we 'backtrack' and try doing the same with the next value until
we find the correct value.

NOTE : No exception handling has been implemented for this project.
